Left Image
- Low pass filter kernel size: 7
- Low pass filter kernel sigma:2.0

Right Image
- Low pass filter kernel size: 3
- Low pass filter kernel sigma:0.1

Mix-in ratio: 0.65


Which image's higher/lower frequencies are used?

Interesting finds: 
- High pass filters does not work very well when hybriding the images for it removes too much details
- Kernel size and sigma has to increase at the same time for blurring effect to increase substaintially
- It works better to aligning eyes and mouth than alining eyes and nose

Thanks for grading, have a nice day : )
